								I was born in Como, Italy on March 26, 1997. I spent my first 18 years of my life in my hometown, and in the years, I have created a strong bond with the culture, the people and everything concerning this city. After High-school I had the opportunity to move outside Como to go studying to a University, which was outside my city, and although the place where I moved was not far from Como, I decided to go live closer to my University. Through this new experience I had the pleasure to live the first experience of living alone and away from home, with this I had the chance to meet a lot of new friends and to try something different, over the years I also had opportunities to also move abroad for temporary experiences. Through all these experiences I realized how good and important your birthplace is, and I think that wherever I go I bring with me a little bit of Como.
